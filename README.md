# MusicalApplication
Sure, designing a music player application based on object-oriented principles involves breaking down the functionalities into objects and classes that represent real-world entities and their interactions. Here's an overview:

Class Structure:
Song Class: This class represents a song and its attributes such as title, artist, duration, genre, etc.

Playlist Class: Contains a collection of songs, allowing users to create, modify, and manage playlists.

User Class: Represents users of the application, storing user information like username, password, preferences, etc.

MusicPlayer Class: The main class that manages the playback functionalities, including play, pause, stop, skip, shuffle, repeat, volume control, etc. It interacts with the playlist and song classes to access and play the songs.

Object Interactions:
Song and Playlist Interaction: Users can add songs to playlists, remove them, create new playlists, and reorder songs within a playlist.

User and Playlist Interaction: Users can create their playlists, delete them, and modify them according to their preferences.

MusicPlayer and Song Interaction: The MusicPlayer class interacts with the Song class to fetch song details, play, pause, stop, or skip songs.
